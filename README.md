# ZIGVULKAN README

## What is it?

zigvulkan is a project for testing out dealing with the Vulkan 3D library using the zig language.

## Goals

- learn about Vulkan
- learn about Zig, its build system and standard library


## Restrictions

- well none, since it is a playground ;-)
- CI builds don't work with dynamic because there is a problem linking dynamically on RISC-V
